# Obsidian ebird search
This plugin let's you search for a bird in ebird, and adds a new page for it in your specified folder with some basic metadata from ebird. 

It uses the public URL for search from ebird.org, which contains an hardcoded key, which can change at any time. The key is provided as a setting which you can update.

## Usage
This plugin is currently not submited to obsidian. You can run it by cloning the repository into `.obsidian/plugins` folder inside your vault and running it locally.

```cmd
$ git clone https://github.com/kaushiksk/obsidian-ebird-search
$ cd obsidian-ebird-search
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

The plugin should now be visible in under community plugins.
