# Obsidian ebird search
This plugin let's you search for a bird in ebird, and adds a new page for it in your specified folder with some basic metadata from ebird. 

It uses the public URL for search from ebird.org, which contains an hardcoded key, which can change at any time. The key is provided as a setting which you can update.
